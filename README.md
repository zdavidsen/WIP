# WIP

This repo holds projects that I feel don't deserve their own repos, for any number of reasons.  They may be e.g small scripts, one-offs, utilities, or larger projects that I just don't want to make a separate repo for (yet), but still want to preserve in source control.

The projects here may be in various states of completion/abandonment.  Some commits may not compile. Some projects may not compile.  That's just the way it's gonna be.
